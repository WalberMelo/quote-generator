## ‚ú® Inspirational Quote Generator ‚ú®

In this epic build, we're going to create a completely serverless quote generator using AWS as our cloud back-end and NextJS/TypeScript as our front-end.

The most epic part is...we're going to be generating images in a server without any expensive software or hardware.

What you'll learn in this build is how to:

üë®‚Äçüíª Build a cool front-end for a quote generator

üí° Write a script to fetch a random inspirational quote from ZenQuotes' API

üå© Use AWS to generate a quote graphic for you in the cloud & then let you download the file

üî• Deploy live

This build combines ZenQuotes' amazing API for fetching quotes, AWS Amplify for framework deployment and hosting, NextJS and Typescript for our front-end, styled-components to handle our styling, and some spicy backend scripting üå∂

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
